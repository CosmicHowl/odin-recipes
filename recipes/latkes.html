        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>During my later years of elementary school, my class participated in a type of "Holidays Around the World" day near Christmas, where each classroom picked a different culture to represent to other classrooms as they toured the school. For those of you in the know, our class decided to do Hanukkah. Among the many activities we set up for the visiting classes, one of the things we did was make potato latkes. I tell you now that as of that day, there is little more in the world I love than a golden-brown latke, properly seasoned, and ready to consume.</p>
        <p>The following recipe from <a href="http://allrecipes.com" id="allrec">AllRecipes</a> is an exact rendition of the taste I experienced that day, and it is with sheer excitement that I share it with all of you!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 medium russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated onion, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. Place shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible.</li>
            <li>Measure 2 cups shredded, drained potatoes and place into a medium bowl; save any extra for another use. Add egg, flour, onion, and salt, and stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Place large spoonfuls of potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties. Cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li>Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you cook any remaining latkes. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="desc">There was a time that I had a bunch of bananas on the verge of going bad, and given that it was approaching the holidays, I thought I might try to make banana bread. Because, you know, I'm a fan of the stuff. Problem was, I started making it and soon realized that I was chronically short on ingredients. Not one to waste a bunch of ingredients I had already used, I did what came naturally: I panicked! But I also managed to improvise. What came out on the other side of the process was some of the richest banana bread I've ever made. Try it for yourselves and enjoy!

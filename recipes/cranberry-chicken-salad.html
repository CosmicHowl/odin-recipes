        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="desc">Disovered by me and a friend of mine while perusing a selection of gas station sandwiches (thank you, Speedway), the both of us loved this sweeter, nuttier twist on what is now considered a much more boring version of the summer picnic classic. While this is not that recipe, it is still both enjoyable and bright to the palate. I hope you enjoy this (more or less verbatim) recipe from <a href="http://allrecipes.com" id="allrec">AllRecipes</a> as much as we have!</p>
        <h2 class="inghead">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingred">
            <li class="ients">1/2 cup mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
            <li class="ients">2 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li class="ients">1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries</li>
            <li class="ients">1/4 green apple, shredded</li>
            <li class="ients">1/4 cup chopped pecans</li>
            <li class="ients">1 tablespoon lime juice</li>

        </section></ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Serve immediately or refrigerate for several hours or overnight (the flavor just gets better).</li>

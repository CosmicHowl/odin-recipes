        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Disovered by me and a friend of mine while perusing a selection of gas station sandwiches (thank you, Speedway), the both of us loved this sweeter, nuttier twist on what is now considered a much more boring version of the summer picnic classic. While this is not that recipe, it is still both enjoyable and bright to the palate. I hope you enjoy this (more or less verbatim) recipe from <a href="http://allrecipes.com">AllRecipes</a> as much as we have!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries</li>
            <li>1/4 green apple, shredded</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped pecans</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and black pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together chicken and mayonnaise in a bowl, stir to coat well. Stir in green onions, dried cranberries, apple, pecans, lime juice, dill weed, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately or refrigerate for several hours or overnight (the flavor just gets better).</li>
        </ol>
